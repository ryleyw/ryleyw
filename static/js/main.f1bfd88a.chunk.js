Thankfully, because of winning the qualifier, I was able to meet many wonderful people in the field of engineering and network with industry prefessionals.","My team and I were tasked with creating a financial management application from scratch, with the theme of building an application that supports community development. We reasoned that by making a simple but intuitive application, that communities could easily integrate into their lives and develop financial knowledge and management. We built the application with technologies that we were the most well versed with. A Flask API was constructed to service sample financial records and handle requests from our user interface. My role on the team was to architect the complete front-end archtecture and develop a intuitive user interface. With most of my front-end experience being in React, I used it as the framework for data sharing and state management.","I worked with Malcolm and Derek to ensure that API endpoints were returning the correct data from AJAX calls and slowly but surely the application came together. Our final product included functionality to view two accounts' Savings and Chequing data, and to add transaction data through form submission, updating the data in real time.","The final piece of the project was a machine learning algorithm to correctly predict stock trending patterns from historical data.
