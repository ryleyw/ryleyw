            Hi! My name's Ryley Woodland and I'm from Victoria, BC. I'm an enthusiastic 4th year Computer Science Major / Business Minor student with applied experience in enterprise software development. As a lifelong-learner I am driven and eager to build on my academic foundations while staying in tune with the latest technologies to develop my career. I am graduating from UVic in April and currently looking for new graduate opportunities for someone of my skillset.
            <br/><br/>
            Right now I'm really into web development. Whether it's designing fun and enchanting front-end experiences or processing data in the back-end, I am bolstering my skillset to be able to build scalable and wide reaching applications.
            <br/><br/>
            I am an excellent communicator. I have built my interpersonal communication skills through my past team-based experiences and public speaking in classes. I have strived to be better at communicating through code, implementing proper documentation, code reviews and paired programming practices to ensure my solutions are clear and can be passed on. My knowledge of web architecture and business operations allow me to communicate in cross functional teams effectively to solve multi-disciplinary challenges.
            <br/><br/>
            I am a creative, logical and analytical problem solver. I identify problems and implement innovative solutions to solve them. I believe collaborative and inclusive teams are key to success, and with them I thrive and excel as a team member.
            <br/><br/>
            I am motivated to contribute and create solutions that will impact and improve the lives of many. However, I wasnâ€™t always as motivated as I am today. I struggled for a long time finding a calling in life and in career. After some reflection I knew I wanted to create, and to help others. Inspired by the technology that surrounded me, and how it had helped me in my life, I wanted to give back in some form. After being in the computer science program for a while I realized web applications were a way to reach a broad audience while creating amazing products.
            <br/><br/>
            I am self-driven. I seek out opportunities to improve both my skillset and myself, koping to shape me into someone better than I was yesterday. I can seek out answers for myself, shown through my research experience or my need to self-teach multiple technologies. 
            <br/><br/>
            I hope the above paragraphs have given you a better sense of who I am! When I'm not working on my schoolwork (busy busy) or coding some side projects, you can find me drawing, playing guitar, making some beats, playing video games with friends, or trying out a new recipe. 
            <br/><br/>
