            Hi, I'm Ryley! I am an enthusiastic 4th year Computer Science Major / Business Minor student with applied experience in enterprise software development. As a lifelong-learner I am driven and eager to build on my academic foundations while staying in tune with the latest technologies to develop my career. I am currently looking for 4 to 8 month opportunities to complete my co-op requirements.
            <br/><br/>
            Right now I'm really into web development. Whether it's designing fun and enchanting front-end experiences or processing data in the back-end, I am bolstering my skillset to be able to build scalable and wide reaching applications.
            <br/><br/>

            I am a creative, logical and analytical problem solver, striving to create innovative solutions to the problems handed to me. I believe collaborative and inclusive teams are key to success, and with them I thrive and excel as a team member.
            <br/><br/>
            When I'm not working on my schoolwork, or coding some side projects, you can find me drawing, playing guitar, playing video games with my friends or trying out a new recipe. 
            <br/><br/>
            For business inquiries, feel free to shoot me an e-mail at ryleywoodland@gmail.com.
